# Cluster_Basecalling_Manager
Repository of the Master Degree thesis of Rodolfo Tolloi. In this repository I'll upload the code and the results.  
The purpouse of this thesis is to create a software that manages the distribution of the workload of a basecalling process over different machine inside a cluster. I'll mainly focus on ONT solutions for basecalling (so Guppy and Dorado) while python was used to code the program  

Most of the test for these infastructure where made using the jain/Homo_sapiens-FAF09968/fast5/Bham/FAF09968-3439856925_Multi dataset from the nanopore_benchmark repo
